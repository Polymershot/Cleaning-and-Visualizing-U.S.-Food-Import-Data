# Cleaning-and-Visualizing-U.S.A.-Food-Import-Data

## Data Source
> https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-food-imports

## Purpose
The purpose of this simple project was to display general info such as how U.S. food imports vary across time and what the tiop importers are for certain food types. After pulling the sheets into R, I had to deal with formatting issues like improper column names, symbols in text, wide-form data, and missing values.

## Remarks
For the first graphic, it will automatically default to all countries after selecting a import type. This means that the graph will produce an average amount for all the countries. To select a single country, just click on the appropriate dot. Compared to ShinyDashboards, the streamlined process with PowerBI is very nice but looking at the DAX and PowerQuery options doesn't make me too excited. Also, if I were to work more with this data, I would have looked into more of the patterns/relationships between the countries and the different import types. However, for the most part, the data mainly serves as a descriptive source.
